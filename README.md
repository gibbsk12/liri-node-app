# liri-node-app

This is the eighth homework assignment for the University of Richmond Coding Bootcamp.

In this assignment, we were asked to create a LIRI bot. Just like iPhone's Siri, LIRI is an app that takes in parameters and returns data. Unlike Siri, which uses spoken language,LIRI is a command line node app.

# Instructions 
To use LIRI:
* Clone the repository.
* Run command "npm install" in Terminal.
* Run command "node liri.js" and one of the following commands:

    1. `my-tweets` will display the last 20 tweets of Duke the Dog and what time they were posted 
    2. `spotify-this-song <song title>`  will display information about the song such as the artist, album name and a preview link
    3. `movie-this <movie title>`  will information about the movie such as Rotten Tomatoes rating, year, plot, and actors
    4. `do-what-it-says` takes the text from random.txt and executes it
